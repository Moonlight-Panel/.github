## About The Project
</center>

Moonlight is a new free and open-source alternative to Pterodactyl,
allowing users to create their own hosting platform and host all sorts of game servers in Docker containers.
The moonlight panel was originaly developed for Endelon Hosting and has been split into a independent project.
The goal of moonlight is to provide an all in one solution for hosting businesses and communities for selling, hosting and
using varios services like webspaces, subdomains and docker based servers
